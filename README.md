# MDS Assessment
Create a small app that fetches South African public holidays for a given year and displays them on a page
### STEP 1 - Create my database, tables and entities
I used my MySQL IDE to create all my tables :
-	country
-	dayofweek
-	holidays

### STEP 2 - Create a console to populate tables
Used the console to create this with the following command:

```sh
> php artisan make:command Holidays
```
